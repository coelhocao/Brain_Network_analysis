# Brain_Network_analysis
R tools to analyze correlation networks from microscopic brain imaging
The code can build networks based on the output data from ClearMap ,
or from independent data.
It includes codes to capture network global general features, modularity,
detect community structures based on consensus clustering (see scripts for references)
calculate global network and community-based nodal metrics,
and finally, perform comparisons between network metrics using permutation of group labels.
